This code was implemented using python 3.8.x

Used packages are:

- Pandas
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Flask
- Numpy

### Instructions for excecuting the program:
1. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

2. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

## Relevant Files

### /Notebook Folder
This is where the jupyter notebook is located, in which the CNN used in the flask app is trained

### /app Folder
run.py is used to launch the flask web application.
